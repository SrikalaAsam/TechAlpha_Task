CSS -StopWatch

A stopwatch with lap timers built entirely with CSS and HTML

Known Issues

Slow touch response in Opera Mobile
Doesn't handle relative font-size values very well. Resizing window while animating puts digits out of alignment.
Limited to 4 laps because each lap requires 5 lines of CSS. So more are possible.

Tested and Working in

Internet Explorer 11
Firefox 49.0.1
Firefox iOS
Opera 41.0
Opera iOS (works but slow touch response)
Safari 10 Desktop and iOS
Chrome Desktop, iOS and Android
